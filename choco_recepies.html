            <b>Recipe:</b><br>
            </p>
            Prep Time: 10 minutes<br>
Ready In: 45 minutes<br>
Yield: 3 9-inch rounds<br><br>

Ingredients<br><br>
butter and flour for coating and dusting the cake pan<br>
3 cups all-purpose flour<br>
3 cups granulated sugar<br>
1½ cups unsweetened cocoa powder<br>
1 tablespoon baking soda<br>
1½ teaspoons baking powder
1½ teaspoons salt<br>
4 large eggs<br>
1½ cups buttermilk<br>
1½ cups warm water<br>
½ cup vegetable oil<br>
2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br><br>

Instructions<br><br>
1.Preheat oven to 350 degrees.<br><br>
2.Butter three 9-inch cake rounds. Dust with flour and tap out the excess. (see cooking lesson below)
3.Mix together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a stand mixer using a low speed until combined.<br><br>
4.Add eggs, buttermilk, warm water, oil, and vanilla. Beat on a medium speed until smooth. This should take just a couple of minutes.<br><br>
5.Divide batter among the three pans. I found that it took just over 3 cups of the batter to divide it evenly.<br><br>
6.Bake for 30-35 minutes until the cake meets the toothpick test (stick a toothpick in and it comes out clean).<br><br>
7.Cool on wire racks for 15 minutes and then turn out the cakes onto the racks and allow to cool completely.<br><br>
8.Frost with your favorite frosting and enjoy!<br><br>
Notes<br><br>
1.The better quality cocoa powder you use the better the cake will taste.<br><br>

Chocolate Cream Cheese Buttercream Frosting<br><br>
Prep Time: 10 minutes<br><br>
Yield: enough frosting for a 3 tiered cake<br><br>

Ingredients<br><br>
1½ cups butter, softened<br>
8 oz cream cheese, softened<br>
1½ cups unsweetened cocoa powder<br>
3 teaspoons vanilla extract<br>
7-8 cups powdered sugar<br>
about ¼ cup milk (as needed)<br><br>
Instructions<br><br>
1.In a large bowl, beat together butter and cream cheese until fluffy. Use a hand mixer or stand mixer for best results<br><br>
2.Add in cocoa powder and vanilla extract. Beat until combined.<br><br>
3.Beat in powdered sugar, 1 cup at a time. Add milk as necessary to make a spreadable consistency. The frosting should be very thick and will thicken even more if refrigerated.<br><br>
Notes<br><br>
1.In the photos above, an extra dark cocoa powder was used in the frosting. Extra dark cocoa will result in a much darker, almost black frosting.<br><br>

            <b>Recipe:</b><br>
            </p>
            Ingredients<br><br>

For the cake<br><br>
50 grams cocoa powder (sifted)<br>
100 grams dark muscovado sugar<br>
250 ml water (boiling)<br>
125 grams unsalted butter (soft - (plus some for greasing))<br>
150 grams caster sugar<br>
225 grams plain flour<br>
½ teaspoon(s) baking powder<br>
½ teaspoon(s) bicarbonate of soda<br>
2 teaspoon(s) vanilla extract<br>
2 medium eggs<br>
For the frosting<br>
125 ml water<br>
30 grams dark muscovado sugar<br>
175 grams unsalted butter (cubed)<br>
300 grams dark chocolate (finely chopped)<br><br>

Method<br><br>

1.Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas mark 4.<br><br>
2.Line the bottoms of both sandwich tins with baking parchment and butter the sides.<br><br>
3.Put the cocoa and 100g dark muscovado sugar into a bowl with a bit of space to spare, and pour in the boiling water. Whisk to mix, then set aside.<br><br>
4.Cream the butter and caster sugar together, beating well until pale and fluffy; I find this easiest with a freestanding mixer, but by hand wouldn't kill you.<br><br>
5.While this is going on -- or as soon as you stop if you're mixing by hand -- stir the flour, baking powder and bicarb together in another bowl, and set aside for a moment.<br><br>
6.Dribble the vanilla extract into the creamed butter and sugar -- mixing all the while -- then drop in 1 egg, quickly followed by a scoopful of flour mixture, then the second egg.<br><br>
7.Keep mixing and incorporate the rest of the dried ingredients for the cake, then finally mix and fold in the cocoa mixture, scraping its bowl well with a spatula.<br><br>
8.Divide this fabulously chocolatey batter between the 2 prepared tins and put in the oven for about 30 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean.<br><br>
9.Take the tins out and leave them on a wire rack for 5--10 minutes, before turning the cakes out to cool.<br><br>
10.But as soon as the cakes are in the oven, get started on your frosting: put the water, 30g muscovado sugar and 175g butter in a pan over a low heat to melt.<br><br>
11.When this mixture begins to bubble, take the pan off the heat and add the chopped chocolate, swirling the pan so that all the chocolate is hit with heat, then leave for a minute to melt before whisking till smooth and glossy.<br><br>
12.Leave for about 1 hour, whisking now and again -- when you're passing the pan -- by which time the cakes will be cooled, and ready for the frosting.<br><br>
13.Set one of the cooled cakes, with its top side down, on a cake stand or plate, and spread with about a third of the frosting, then top that with the second cake, regular way up, and spread the remaining frosting over the top and sides, swirling away with your spatula. You can go for a smooth look, but I never do and probably couldn't.<br><br>

            <b>Recipe:</b><br>
            </p>
            INGREDIENTS<br><br>
3 Eggs Whisked<br>
1/2 Cup of Sugar<br>
1/2 Cup of Cake Flour<br>
1/4 Cup of Cocoa Powder<br>
1/2 Tsp of Vanilla Extract<br>
2 Tbsps of Chocolate Chips (Melted) *I used Milk<br>
1 Tbsp of Instant Coffee<br>
1/4 Cup of Hot Water<br><br>

Whipped Cream<br><br>
3/4 Cup of Heavy Whipping Cream<br>
1 Tbsp of Powdered Sugar<br>
1/2 Tsp of Vanilla Extract<br><br>


1- Whisk together the Cocoa Powder, Instant Coffee, Vanilla Extract, Melted Chocolate and Hot Water in a small bowl. Set aside.<br><br>
2- In a large bowl, mix eggs and sugar together with an electric mixer until it doubles in volume and turns pale, light and fluffy in appearance. (Beat for about 5-10 minutes to get the right consistency)<br><br>
3- Add the Chocolate mixture into the light egg and sugar mixture you've set aside in Step 1. Whisk until well combined and mixed through.<br><br>
4- Gradually sift in the flour and gently mix with a small whisk to prevent flour lumps. Do not overmix otherwise you'll have bread-y/chewy cupcakes! <br><br>
5- Once the batter is well mixed and combined, portion the batter evenly into cupcake liners with an ice-cream scoop.<br><br>
6- Bake at a preheated 180C for 20-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into a center of a cupcakes comes out clean without any batter!<br><br>
7- In a large bowl, pour your heavy whipping cream, along with the powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Simply use a whisk and some elbow-grease to whip the cream until it forms a soft peak. (Go ahead and use your electric mixer, you know you want to.<br><br>
8- Place the whipped cream into a piping bag fitted with a 'star tip' and gently pipe your desired pattern. Decorate as you like- be as creative as you can!<br><br>
