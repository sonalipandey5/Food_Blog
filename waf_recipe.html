            </p>
            Ingredients:<br><br>

1 cup Flour<br>
4 tspn Sugar<br>

1/8 tspn Baking Soda<br>
1 Egg Seperated<br>
1 tblspn Canola Oil<br>
2 tblspn Non-Salt Butter (Melted)<br>
1 cup Water<br><br>

Directions:<br><br>

1. Heat up your waffle iron while you gather your ingredients. I use a medium setting which gives me a nice lightly browned waffle.<br><br>

2. In a medium bowl add your flour, sugar, salt, baking powder and baking soda. Stir together.<br><br>

3. Add separated egg yolk and water to flour (dry ingredients). Mix it all together.<br><br>

4. Add melted butter and canola oil. Mix together.<br><br>

5. In a small bowl beat your egg white until fluffy or lighter. Add to your batter and mix together.<br><br>

            <b>Recipe:</b><br>
            </p>
            INGREDIENTS: <br><br>
4 tablespoons (1/4 cup) melted butter<br>
1 cup mashed potatoes (a little more or less is okay)<br>
1/4 cup grated cheese<br>
3/4 cup milk<br>
1/4 cup sour cream (or plain yogurt)<br>
3/4 cup AP flour<br>
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br>
1/4 teaspoon salt<br>
1/4 teaspoon black pepper<br>
1 teaspoon fresh minced herbs (thyme, rosemary, dill, parsley)<br>
Optional toppings: more sour cream, butter, bacon bits, broccoli in cheese sauce<br><br>
INSTRUCTIONS<br><br>
1.Whisk the melted butter, potatoes, cheese, milk and sour cream together until combined.<br><br>
2.Add flour, baking powder, and spices and mix quickly. Batter will be quite thick, like cake batter. Add a little more milk or flour to adjust the consistency if you need to.<br><br>
3.Spoon about 1/2 cup scoops onto a hot waffle iron and spread the batter out a little. Close and cook until the waffle stops steaming and opens easily.<br><br>
4.Serve as-is or with more butter.<br><br>
5.For a more elaborate dinner, serve hot potato waffles with a baked potato-bar type set-up (bowls of sour cream, chopped chives, bacon bits, broccoli, cheese sauce) for people to dress their waffles.<br><br>
