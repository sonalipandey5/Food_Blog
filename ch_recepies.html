            <b>Recipe:</b><br>
            </p>

Ingredients<br><br>

Makes about 12-16 servings<br><br>

Crust<br><br>
250 g (about 2 packages of 16 oreos each) oreo cookies, cream removed
6 tbsp (80 g) unsalted butter, melted<br><br>

Cream Cheese Filling<br><br>
35 oz (1 kg) cream cheese, room temperature<br>
3/4 cup (175g) heavy cream + 2 tbsp, cold <br>
2/3 cup (190g) Nutella<br>
1 cup (200g) sugar<br>
1 tbsp cornstarch<br>
2 tsp vanilla extract<br>
4 eggs, room temperature<br>

Nutella Topping<br><br>
2/3 cup (190g) Nutella<br>
1/3 cup (80g) heavy cream<br><br>

Directions<br><br>

1. Prepare the crust. Preheat oven to 350 F (180C). Remove the cream between oreo cookies and crush them using a food processor. Melt butter and pour over the crushed cookies. Process until evenly moistened. Press cookie mixture with the back of the spoon into the bottom of a 10-inch (26 cm) springform pan (with a removable base). Bake for 13-15 minutes. Set aside to cool completely. <br><br>

2. Reduce oven temperature to 300 F (150C). <br><br>

3. Prepare the cream cheese filling. In a bowl combine the sugar with cornstarch.<br><br>

4. In a large bowl beat the cream cheese with 3/4 cup heavy cream until well combined and the mixture seems fluffy as the heavy cream has whipped a bit. (This is very important, because this is what makes possible creating the 2 layers effect.) Gradually add the sugar mixture and mix until creamy and smooth. Add vanilla extract and mix again until well combined. Add eggs one at a time until each egg is incorporated.<br><br>

5. Reserve about 1/3 of cream cheese mixture in a separate bowl. Add Nutella and 2 tbsp of heavy cream over the reserved 1/3 of cream cheese mixture and mix well until incorporated.<br><br>

6. Pour the white cream cheese mixture over the prepared crust. Carefully add Nutella mixture on top and use a rubber spatula to spread evenly.<br><br>

7. Bake for 45-55 minutes on 300F (150C). Turn off the heat and leave it another hour in the oven.<br><br>

8. Remove and run a sharp knife completely around the inside edge of the pan. Let it cool completely at room temperature.<br><br>

9. Prepare the Nutella topping. Bring cream to a boil and pour over the Nutella. Mix well and spread evenly over the cheesecake.<br><br>

10. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Decorate with some chopped hazelnuts before serving if desired.<br><br>

            </p>
Start to Finish: 5 hours (includes cooling time)<br>

Prep Time: 30 minutes<br>

Servings: 16<br>

Ingredients:<br>

Crust<br><br>

1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs<br>
1/4 cup of sugar<br>
8 tablespoons butter, (1 stick) melted<br>
1/4 cup of sugar<br>

Filling<br><br>

4 (8 oz) packages of cream cheese, softened<br>
1 1/4 cup sugar<br>
2 teaspoons vanilla<br>
2 tablespoon lemon juice<br>
5 eggs<br>
2 tablespoons of flour<br>

Sour Cream Layer<br><br>

1 pint of sour cream<br>
1/3 cup of sugar<br>
1/2 teaspoon vanilla<br>
1 tablespoon lemon juice<br>

Garnish (optional)<br><br>

Fresh sliced strawberries<br>
Strawberry sundae syrup<br>
Whipped cream -- See my video for how to make home made Whipped Cream<br>
Directions:<br><br>

HEAT oven to 325°F.<br><br>

1.In a bowl mix graham cracker crumbs, sugar and butter, press onto bottom and slightly up the sides of 10-inch spring-form pan. Bake in oven for 10 minutes.<br><br>

2.While crust is baking, make the filling by beating the cream cheese, sugar, vanilla and lemon with electric mixer until smooth and well blended. Add eggs, 1 at a time, mixing at medium speed after each egg is added until all is blended making sure to scrape down the batter with a spatula. Add flour and mix until smooth.<br><br>

3.Remove crust from oven, but keep oven on and let the crust cool for 5-10 minutes then pour the filling over crust. Bake for about 50-55 minutes or until cake is cooked but has a slight giggle in the center.<br><br>

4.Remove from oven, again keeping oven on and set aside for 5-10 minutes so it cools slightly while you make the sour cream topping. In a small bowl mix the sour cream, sugar, vanilla and lemon. Spoon over the top of the cheesecake and spread evenly. Put cake back in oven and bake for 10 minutes.<br><br>

5.Remove from oven and loosen cake from rim of pan with knife. Cool before refrigerating. Cover and refrigerate at least 3 hours or over night.<br><br>

6.Before serving, remove rim from pan and plate and slice cake. Garnish each slice with fresh strawberries and a drizzle of strawberry sundae syrup along with some whipped cream.<br><br>

7.Cooking Tips:<br><br>

8.Wrapping foil around the bottom of the pan helps to keep anything from dripping out while baking.<br><br>

9.It is best to store the cheesecake in the spring-form pan until ready to serve. The pan will protect it from getting bumped in the refrigerator.<br><br>

10.Slice cake using a hot, wet knife, wiping knife blade clean in between slices.<br><br>

11.Store leftover cheesecake in the refrigerator.<br><br>

12.Whipped Cream Cheese can be replaced for half of the recipe. I sometimes like to use 2 whipped and 2 regular 8 oz. packages.<br><br>

13.Other options for the crust: You can replace the Graham Crackers with Chocolate cookies or vanilla wafer,<br><br>

14.If making this recipe for Passover you can use crushed macaroons or crushed matzo for the crust in place of the Graham Crackers. If you need to replace the flour in the recipe you can use potato starch.<br><br>

            <b>Recipe:</b><br>
            </p>
            Ingredients<br><br>
10 - 12 vanilla Oreo cookies<br>
2 tbsp of melted butter<br>
100 grams of cream cheese at room temperature<br>
3 tbsp of confectioners sugar<br>
¼ tsp of vanilla extract<br>
250 ml of whipping cream, chilled<br><br>

Instructions<br><br>

Add 8 Oreo cookies to a mixing bowl. Using the tip of a meat tenderizer or the tool of your choice, break them up so the resemble dry, crumbly sand. Add in 2 tbsp of melted butter. Mix it together until it resembles a wet sand. Add it to the bottom of a spring form pan and pack it down gently using a spatula.
Add the whipping cream to a mixing bowl. Using a whisk or electric mixer, beat it until it doubles in volume and peaks form. This should take about 3 to 5 minutes. Set it aside in the fridge or in a cool place. Make sure the whipping cream is chilled before using it.<br><br>

Put the cream cheese in another mixing bowl. Add in the confectioners sugar and the vanilla extract. Mix until it's well combined and creamy. Add the whipped cream to the cream cheese mixture and beat it together.<br><br>

Break up the other 2 Oreo cookies into tiny bits and fold them into the mixture.<br><br>

Add the cream cheese mixture into the spring form pan so it comes to the top. Smooth it out with a spatula and top it with bits of Oreo cookies.<br><br>

Place it in the fridge and chill until it's set. This should take 5 to 6 hours but overnight is preferred. You can also set it aside in the freezer to have an ice cream consistency. Serve and enjoy your no bake Oreo cheesecake.<br><br>
